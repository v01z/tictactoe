# tictactoe

A simple classic TicTacToe, a terminal-based game.


INSTALLATION:
-------------------------------------------------

git clone https://github.com/v01z/tictactoe.git

cd tictactoe

make


RUN:
-------------------------------------------------
./tictactoe

The game starts with a size of a table  3x3, but
you can change it by adding whatever you want (more
than 1x1).
For example:

./tictatoe 10

Moreover, you can change length of line (second argument)
that one should fill to win.
For example:

./tictactoe 7 5

You play 'X', computer plays 'O'. Good luck!
